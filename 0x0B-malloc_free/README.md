0x0B-malloc_free
Dynamic memory allocation

The malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated
memory

We have to check malloc() return before set values to pointer.

The free() function frees the memory space, which must have
been returned by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() or realloc().
